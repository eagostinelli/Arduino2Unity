In this repository I will collect the script for 
1. Arudino: the user could easily use this code to have a simple board with two LEDs that light up if a button is pressed (right-left). 
2. Unity3D: the user will need to attach this C# script to the object of interest and will be able to move the object in Unity by usgin the button on Arduino. 

Blog with instructions: coming soon
